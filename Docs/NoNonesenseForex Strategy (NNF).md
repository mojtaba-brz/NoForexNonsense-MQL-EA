# NoNonesenseForex Strategy (NNF)

## Main Tools Of The Strategy

1. **ATR Indicator**
	* This tool is used **to determine the Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP) levels**. The SL is set at 1.5 times the ATR, and the first TP is set at 1 times the ATR.
	* It is also used for **money management**, which is the most important part of a trading strategy.
	* For more details see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqWLFNpK6eg)
	* To learn about the NNF money management method, see this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPqWQo6-TXfE8G_Mmxow0znSSoWTu44e7)

2. **Baseline**
	* This tool generates safe-to-buy/sell signals.
	* The [One Candle Rule](#tactics) does not apply.

			2. Cross-over Indicator (Cross over/under is a buy/sell signal)
			3. Chart Indicator (if candle closed above/below the indicator, it is a buy/sell signal)

4. **2nd Confirmation Indicator**
	* This tool generates *safe to buy/sell* signals

## Tactics

* [Scaling Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJBmVhefMeE) : open two equal positions at the same time. set TP for **one** and set SL for both. after the first one hits the TP move the other's SL to break-even. other rules are applied for both. **this technic save some profits for you and also gives you a big trend profit.**
* [Use trailing stops at 1.5xATR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsc_1GwKINM)
* [One Candle Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW2-91DNlIM) : when there is a buy/sell signal, but other tools say it is not safe, you have to wait. after getting the green light, if price went up/down the same amount of ATR from where buy/sell signals had been generated, the buy/sell signal is not valid anymore.
* [$EVZ as a Volatility Indication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Kbk0cwIWg) : 
	1. go to [barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$EVZ](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$EVZ/overview)
	2. if $EVZ >  8 then it is safe to trade
* [Pullbacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JssEr6mopDc) : 
	1. after getting the green light to enter, if price is 1 x ATR or more from your baseline, do not enter. 
	2. wait ***just one candle*** for price to retrace back to baseline.
	3. if it closed less than 1 x ATR from your baseline, enter the trade
* [Continuation Trades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFM5t_XjwQ) : this tactic is about entering again in the same trend. when using this tactic, do not apply volume indicator and one candle rule. *don't forget to see the link for more details*
